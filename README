-f: features to be done
-p: proportion of data division. Example: -p 50, half of data will
be used on learning and half on tests
-v: cross validation. Create v parts of data of same size and use v-1
on train and test on last one, all parts are tested one time. -v max use
the size of data, training with data -1 and testing on the last one.
-t: number of times the process will be done
-r: the change of w on each time of process
-w1: the initial value of w1
-w-1: the initial value of w-1
-d: delete all files of input user
-fm: run the fast mode of cross-validation
-ft: load the first db as training base and the second db as test base,
if that methos is being used the cross-validation methos can't be used.

It can be runned by command line, like this:
python svm_codes.py users/user2.xml -f 0,2,7,8,12,13,14,17,18,22,25,27,29,30,31 -d -w1 98.2 -w-1 1.8 -r 0.1 -t 1 -v max -fm
python svm_codes.py users/user1.xml -f 0,2,7,8,12,13,14,17,18,22,25,27,29,30,31 
python svm_codes.py users/user2.xml -ft users/user4.xml -f 0,2,7,8,12,13,14,17,18,22,25,27,29,30,31 -d -w1 98.2 -w-1 1.8 -r 0.1 -t 1

The run_svm.py is used to run several times the svm_codes.py
